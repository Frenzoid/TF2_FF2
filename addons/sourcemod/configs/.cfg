//		How to edit this file:
//		"admin_colors"										<--	Leave this alone
//		{																<--	Add all groups/steamids after first bracket (Leave this alone)
//																			
//			"STEAM_0:1:1234567"						<--	Here is a steamid example with a tag (don't duplicate steamids)
//			{
//				"namecolor"		"{T}"						<--	This is the color for the name
//				"textcolor"		"{N}"						<--	This is the color of the text
//			}
//
//			"groupname"											<--	This can either be a steamid for a specific player, or a group name
//			{															<--	Open the group
//				"flag"				"z"							<--	This is the flag(s) assoicated with the group.  This field doesn't matter if the group name is a steamid
//				"tag"				"[admin]"					<--	This is the text for the tag
//				"tagcolor"		"{G}"						<--	This is the color for the tag
//				"namecolor"		"{G}"						<--	This is the color for the name
//				"textcolor"		"{N}"						<--	This is the color of the text
//			}															<--	Close the group
//		}																<--	Add all groups/steamids before last bracket (Leave this alone)
//
//		NOTE:
//		If you don't enter a steamid then the group name does not matter, it's just for your reference.
//
//		For a better understanding of what these colors mean, how they work, and on what games, see this link:
//		http://forums.alliedmods.net/showpost.php?p=1398702&postcount=2
//		Thanks to everyone working on the smlib for the great .inc files!
//
//		--------ORDER OF OPERATIONS--------
//		
//		The order in which you place items in the config file matters.  Here is what determins what color they get:
//		1. SteamID
//			If there is a steamid present, it will always override everything.  If you put a steamid in twice
//			then the first entry (top to bottom) will be used. (I think, just don't do it!)
//		2. Groups
//			The plugin will search (top to bottom) for a postitive match for the flag string.  The player' flags
//			will be compared with the group flag string, and if the player has all the flags, it will stop there.
//			For example. Admins with the "ad" flags and donators with the "a" flag.  If you place the "a" flag group
//			above the "d" group then the admin will get the "a" colors. Order matters.  
//			You can use more than 1 flag for the group. You could have made the admin group with the "ad" flag,
//			but it will always take the first match.
//
