## Contributors.
- I+D Plugins, sourcepawn scripting, permissions, plugins management and dev  -> [Frenzoid][frenzoidsteam]
- I+D Plugins, Weapon attributes manager, gameplay balancing, custom weapons, store and tags manager -> [Nezzie][nezziesteam]

## Extra things and reminders.
- The `automated` folder contains the following:
  -  `compressallbz2.sh`: A script that compresses all INDIVIDUAL files recusivelly inside their own folder, takes as first argument the path to compress the files from.
  -  `compilemaps.sh`: A script that compiles all maps from `maps/` into `sourcemod/config/mapchooser-extended/maps/tf.txt` and `cfg/mapcycle.txt`
  
- **ALL CUSTOM FILES MUST HAVE THEIR UNCOMPRESSED BZ2 VERSION BESIDE THEM, FAILURE TO PERFORM THE FOLLOWING *WILL* CAUSE SERVER SIDE ARTIFACTS**
- `nginxconf.txt`: A default usable FDL NGINX server configuration.
- `cfg/mapcycle.txt` and `addons/sourcemod/config/mapchooser-extended/maps/tf.txt`: must be the same or else the MPE plugin will fail to verify.
- `addons/sourcemod/config/custom-chatcolors.cfg`: GROUPS are specified by FLAGS and not GROUP NAMES.
- `addons/sourcemod/config/adminmenu_custom.txt`: custom admin menu, make it more easier for your server operators to manage plugins in-game.

- `mce_menustyle` `"1"`: Mapchooser-extended is set to use the old style valve menu, this is to avoid mindless voting, so people who want to actually contribute to the vote have to go back to the main menu and select a map from a pop-up window.
- The command `find ./ -name "*.bz2" -exec bzip2 -d {} + &` can be used to uncompress all bz2 files in their respective folders.
