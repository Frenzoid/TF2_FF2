## How to run this repo on your server.
- 1) Install your TF2 vanilla server on a directory ( any directory will do ).
- 2) Stop the server.
- 3) Copy-Paste or git-clone this repository directly in your tf2 server dir.
- 4) Uncompress all materials, below you'll find a bash command which does all of this for you.
- 5) Configure the rcon password and the databases credentials and addresses.
- 6) OPTIONAL: If you use a FDL with Nginx, theres a configuration which you might find helpful.
- 8) OPTIONAL: If you have the `screen` command installed, you can start the server by running the `start_server.sh` script.
- 9) Start the server.
- 10) Pray it doesn't crash because of SourceMod has to cope with 100 different plugins developed for different versions of SourcePawn from the last decade.

## Contributors.

## Extra things and reminders.
- The `automated` folder contains the following:
  -  `compressallbz2.sh`: A script that compresses all INDIVIDUAL files recusivelly inside their own folder, takes as first argument the path to compress the files from.
  -  `compilemaps.sh`: A script that compiles all maps from `maps/` into `sourcemod/config/mapchooser-extended/maps/tf.txt` and `cfg/mapcycle.txt`

-  `autocommit.sh`: A script ran by crontab every 2 days, it updates this repository with any changes that devs / admins made during the week.
-  `ipdrop.sh`: A script used to root-block via iptables any ip passded as parameter ( used during a time when people tried to DDoS and Brute Force password attack our services ).
  
- **ALL CUSTOM FILES MUST HAVE THEIR UNCOMPRESSED BZ2 VERSION BESIDE THEM, FAILURE TO PERFORM THE FOLLOWING *WILL* CAUSE SERVER SIDE ARTIFACTS**
- `nginxconf.txt`: A default usable FDL NGINX server configuration.
- `cfg/mapcycle.txt` and `addons/sourcemod/config/mapchooser-extended/maps/tf.txt`: must be the same or else the MPE plugin will fail to verify.
- `addons/sourcemod/config/custom-chatcolors.cfg`: GROUPS are specified by FLAGS and not GROUP NAMES.
- `addons/sourcemod/config/adminmenu_custom.txt`: custom admin menu, make it more easier for your server operators to manage plugins in-game.

- `mce_menustyle` `"1"`: Mapchooser-extended is set to use the old style valve menu, this is to avoid mindless voting, so people who want to actually contribute to the vote have to go back to the main menu and select a map from a pop-up window.
- The command `find ./ -name "*.bz2" -exec bzip2 -d {} + &` can be used to uncompress all bz2 files in their respective folders.
